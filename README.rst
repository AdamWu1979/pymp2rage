=========
PyMP2RAGE
=========

This package is a lightweight python implementation of the algorithms described in Marques et al. (2010). They can be used to compute a unified T1-weighted, as well as a quantiative T1 map out of the two phase- and magnitude-images of a MP2RAGE-sequences.

Installation
============
To install clone this repository and install it with git:

    pip install git+https://github.com/Gilles86/pymp2rage

Usage
=====
For some examples of its usage see the `example notebook <notebooks/MP2RAGE%20and%20T1%20fitting.ipynb>`_

Readthedocs
===========
